Digital-Image-Correlation
=========================

Strain mapping of heterogeneous biological tissues with MATLAB.

##Dependencies

* MATLAB 7 or later. MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox.
* 'Digital Image Correlation & Tracking with Matlab' - 
[Digital Image Correlation & Tracking with MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/12413-digital-image-correlation-and-tracking "Digital Image Correlation & Tracking with MATLAB")

##Usage

This project is really just a collection of functions that are built to work with the 'Digital Image Correlation & Tracking' package, linked above. The DIC package is really powerful and customizable, and it has it's own readme. You should check out the DIC readme for help with the specific functions.

There are three parts to making a typical measurement of strains in an image series:

1. `filelist_generator.m` Build a *file name list*, which is just an ordered list of the images you want to analyze, and save them to *filenamelist.mat*.
2. `grid_generator.m` Select a grid of points to track from image to image. These are saved in *.mat* files called *grid_x.mat* and *grid_y.mat*. You can read the DIC readme for for information about these data structures. long story short - grid_x and grid_y are just arrays of the initial x- and y-coordinates of each gridpoint. Pretty simple.
3. `automate_image.m` Measure the displacement of those gridpoints from one
4. 


##Tests

In order to lend confidence to your results, you might want to generate some test images where you decide the exact deformations that take place. Check out the example test images generated by performing a simple [Affine Transformation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine Transformation on Wikipedia"), in the subdirectory [Strain Map Testing](http://github.com/dd7ler/Digital-Image-Correlation/tree/master/Strain%20Map%20Testing). There are also some example scripts which might be helpful for making your own test images, relevant to the types of deformations you are trying to measure. The script *StrainError.m* might be useful as a template for quantifying the error in test images.
